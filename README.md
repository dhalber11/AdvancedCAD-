## Swing Arm

### Description
For this assignment we were given an Onshape document with plans for a "Swing Arm". We were tasked with recreating this part using the given dimensions and answering a few questions that changed certain values within the part.

### Reflection
This assignment was a bit of a more difficult one for me. Overall there was a trick to it that involved using constraints on all of the lines before you used dimensioning. This allowed a lot more ease when dimensioning and saved you from dimensioning multiple things. I had a few issues with the constraints when they overlapped but that was fixed through the simplest way possible, guess and check. This was a helpful assignemnt and we have had one more in the past that was similar to this.


## Pull Copter 

### Description
For this assingment we were split into partners and given an assignment that had two parts, Student A and Student B. Student B was a bit more challenging and this was my job for this assignment. We had to follow the given steps to design a pull copter that met the criteria provided.

### Reflection
This assignment was relatively easy for me as there was step by step info on how we were meant to do it. Most of the tools that we used were review for me but some were new such as the sweep tool and others. It went relatively smoothly and no notable issues arose during the design. It was fun to design this prop and see it all come together using shared assemblies.

## Multi-Part Design Studios

### Description
For this assignment we had a prompt similar to the swing arm but in the format of the Onshape Certification test. We were given pdfs of Design Intents as well as some dimensions and we were required to fully design the part and then answer four questions that changed certain dimensions. Answers were based on weight.

### Reflection
Overall I did have some difficulty with this assignment mainly during the transition between questions. As I was changing dimensions something would get thrown off and I would be stuck trying to find out what that was. My main issue was constraints and what in the Part that I based new sketches off of. Everything is based off of another thing so if one changed then the other might come with it. In the end I got some help from Mr.H and he was a great help in finding what was off with my designs. This assignment was very useful as it was good practice for the Onshape Certification.
